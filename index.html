ABOUT
For this exercise, I started with the simple task of creating a button that adds 10 to the total number. When the number reaches 100, it resets to zero. 

Along the way, I had more ideas on what to build based on the adjascent capabilities. ie. Once I figured out how to add 10, subtracting 10 was a matter of copy/paste and flipping the sign.

Read the CSS and JS sections to see what I learned while building this.
